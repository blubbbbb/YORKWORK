## further research plans, 
## group consultation plans, peer editing deadlines, 

powerpoint/presentation plans:
Obviously we can use Prezi when a screen is available and probably when not, as long as we can make the entire class download 
the Prezi Viewer app, which may be too much for them. If so, we can share photo's via other means of communication like Discord or
whatsapp.

National Railway Museum 
Leeman Road, York YO26 4XJ (Close to railway station)
